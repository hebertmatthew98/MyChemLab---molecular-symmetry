# MyChemLab
# line test algorithm for molecular symmetry program.

# This project file is for codeblocks IDE, while I work on a visual studio project with implemented UI.
# Currently working on file dialogue to read molecule information from .mol files, and adjust the xyz coordinates to origin for reference.
# Be sure to type num of atoms in header file and the coord for each atom in array inputCoord.
